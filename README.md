## Visual Zombies
A Hideous Destructor graphics addon.

Intends to give new sprites to a few enemies that don't have them, while also keeping the addon coop compatible (As in, one person can have it loaded while another one doesn't without causing a desync).

**Currently adds new sprites and sound definitions (check sndinfo.txt for details) to the following enemies:**
*  SMG Zombies **(POS2)**
*  Helmetted Jackboots **(SPO2)**
*  Slayer Jackboots **(SPO3)**
*  Mage Imps **(TRO2)**
*  Healer Imps  **(TRO3)**
  
Originally intended to just cover the SMG Zombie and Helmetted Jackboot, I added in the Mage and Healer Imps aswell. Couldn't think of a better name though.
